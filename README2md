# Hand Gesture Controlled Animation System 🚀

This interactive system uses real time hand gesture recognition to control engaging visual animations like bubbles and rain using just your fingers. Powered by MediaPipe and OpenCV, the system reads webcam input and tracks hand movements to switch between different animations, offering an intuitive and fun way to interact with your screen.







### ❄️ Key Features
- Real Time Hand Gesture Detection – Recognizes finger counts to trigger different animations (1 finger = bubbles, 2 fingers = rain).
- Rain Animation – Simulates falling rain with white drops dynamically resetting when they reach the bottom.
- Bubble Animation – Beautiful bubbles float up the screen, complete with a shiny highlight effect.
- Live Webcam Integration – Captures and processes real time video input using OpenCV.
